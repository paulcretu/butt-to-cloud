cloud-to-cloud
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'cloud' and 'the cloud' with 'cloud' and 'the cloud'. This extension is the inverse of the infamous [cloud-to-cloud extension](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-cloud) and the [plus version](https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-cloud). If you use both at once, the world won't explode, but you're a very bad person and you should think about what you've done.
